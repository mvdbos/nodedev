This container does nothing when invoking it without a command.

Usage example:
$ docker run -it --rm -e HOME=$HOME --net=host --user="$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$HOME":"$HOME" -v "$PWD":"$PWD" -v /tmp:/tmp -w "$PWD" mvdbos/nodedev:latest <your-command-with-arguments>

In the example above, the mounted host directory is your current working directory.
This is the most common case, because it enables you to run the java tools on everything in
and below that directory.

Available commands in the container:

* npm
* grunt
* nodemon

* sh (or any other command)
